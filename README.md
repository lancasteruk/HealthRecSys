## Nudging Healthier Choices

[Dataset: final_study_nudging_healthier_choices.csv](final_study_nudging_healthier_choices.csv)

This dataset was collected as part of research work on helping people to make healthier food choices by nudging. 

There were two algorithms, top10 and images, that used different features of online recipes to predict which of a given pair or recipes, A and B, a random user would likely choose. These recipes pairs were chosen such that the two recipes are similar in terms of their constituent ingredient but have a large percentage difference in their fat content per 100g. Research shows that, other things kept fixed, people typically choose fattier foods and so the idea was to choose similar pairs where we predicted that, despite this tendency, users would more frequently choose the healthier (i.e. less fatty) option.

The data is strcutured as follows:

id - internal ID number for this specific trial

pair_id - internal ID number for the recipe pair

user_id - anonimised participant ID

q1 - the recipe the participant chose

algorithm - the algorithm used to generated the pairs and predictions (see the paper for details)

diff_fat - the difference in fat between the two recipes (fat_recipe1 - fat_recipe2)

correct_answer - the "correct" response (i.e. the least fatty recipe)

answer - the recipe the participant chose

gain - 1 when the algorithm correctly predicted the chosen recipe, 0 otherwise
